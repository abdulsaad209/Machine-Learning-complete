    "# Curse of Dimensionality\n",
    "The Curse of Dimensionality is termed by mathematician R. ... The curse of dimensionality basically means that the error increases with the increase in the number of features. It refers to the fact that algorithms are harder to design in high dimensions and often have a running time exponential in the dimensions."

    "### 1. Performance decreases\n",
    "* Because when the dimension increases the data points go away from each other so the distance in between the points increases due to this when i apply the distance culculating based algorithm upon this data so the performance decreases because there is a huge distance between data points\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. computation time expands OR Increases\n",
    "* This is simple to understand. Just imagine that you have huge amount of features. When you measure the distance of every point to another point and let's say there are 700 data points so you according to the distance equation **V=S/t** so when we calculate the speed of coputation or running the code so it's directly proportional to distance so it takes hug time to compute and require more speed for this computation."
