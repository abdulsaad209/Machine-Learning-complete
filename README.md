# Feature-Engineering
This repository is created on feature engineering topics

In Feature Engineering there are 4 steps including

1. Feature Transformation

            i) Missing value imputation
            
            ii) Handling Categorical features
            
                            i) OneHot Encoding
                            ii) Ordinal Encoding
                            iii) Label Encoding
            
            iii) Outlier detection
            
             iv)  Feature Scaling
             
                            1-Standardization & Normalization
                            
                            2-Function Transformer
                                        i) Logarithmic Transformation
                                        ii) Reciprocal Transformation
                                        iii) Square Root Transformation
                                        iv) Custom (i can transform data in normal distribution by my self by applying any mathematical equation)
                              
                            3-Power Transformation

                                        Box Cox Transformation
